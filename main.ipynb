    "<b> Context </b>\n",
    "Rumour has it that in The Netherlands attitudes on seemingly unrelated topics are grouped within certain political parties.\n",
    "They say - for example - that climate change-sceptiscim and Covid19-denial are often found in political parties that are also less open to immigrants or are more conservative. I'm curious to find out if there is a truth in this rumour. Analyzing the European Social Survey of 2016 might give a glimpse of the answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Objective </b>\n",
    "In this notebook, I will use different models to try to predict whether someone thinks to what degree climate change is real. The focus is on learning to use and evaluate different machine learning techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The data</b>\n",
    "The data belongs to the European Social Survey (2016). The European Social Survey is an multi-country survey that aims to unravel public opinions on different topics. All editions have recurring questions concerning public attitudes and values towards eg media, social trust and politics. On top of that, each edition has an extra topic. In 2016 they researched public attitudes to climate change, energy security, and energy preferences and welfare attitudes. See the data folder for more information about the Survey and the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Approach </b>\n",
    "I will use the csv in which the NaNs are filled and no rows or columns are lost. First I will compare the performance of the four different models on the entire dataset, leaving in climate- and energy- related questions.\n",
    "Next I will see how well the model performs when it does <i>not</i> have these climate and energy- related questions at it's disposal."
